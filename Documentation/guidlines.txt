 Please follow these guidelines to ensure minimal errors on working on the project.

Before starting to make changes on the project, it is recommended to do git pull first to get all updates from the remote main repo.

Let the team know what are you working on so we avoid duplicate tasks.

If anything needs to add and it is necessary, please add.

We apply KISS as much as possible.

If you're stuck on something. Shout out so we can un-stuck you.

Please make descriptive concise description when doing a commit and pull request tasks. This will be easier to track down what changes made on that version.

Make versions on as often as possible, ideally for every milestone of the task. It will be easier for us to revert back to previous version if there is an error.

It would be nice after you updated the main repo, please let the team know.

If unsure of the merge, please let the team know.
