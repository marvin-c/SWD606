Preparation

1. install latest python
2. install pip with python install pip
2. pip or pip3 install pipenv
- on linux, echo 'export PATH="/home/mcjev/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

Create a server and run it
python manage.py runserver

To create an app module
python manage.py startapp <APPNAME>
# python manage.py startapp playground
# python manage.py startapp vma

Everytime an app module is created, it needs to register it on the settings.py. Add the appname under INSTALLED_APPS = [].
# In this case, we add "playground" under /storefront/settings.py
In this case, we add "playground" under /vma/settings.py


Views
Views located on <APPNAME>/views.py
add functions to it.

After adding functions, it needs to map URLs to views

Mapping URLs to views
under <APPNAME> add <FILENAME.py> file. In this case, we add urls.py


Templates
- this are the html files
1. add templates folder to <APPNAME>. In this case, add templates folder to playground folder
2. add any .html files under templates.

2. click create a launch.json file
3. from the list, choose Django
4. add "9000" after "runserver" under "args":[].

6. on vscode, click start debugging.
7. on the browser, run the current url desired to debug on.
